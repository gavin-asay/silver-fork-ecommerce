# Silver Fork E-commerce Back End

## Description

This application consists of a series of API endpoints for an online store featuring products in various categories with various tags attached. The data is stored in MySQL and managed by a Sequelize implementation.

## Usage

To set up the database, open MySQL in the command line and run the commands `source db/schema.sql`, then `source db/seeds.sql` to use sample data. Then, start the server using `npm start` or `node server` and test the API endpoints.
